# Pre-work - SimpleTodo

SimpleTodo is an easy to use Android aplication that allows users to keep track of basic todo items.
Users can add items with a touch of a button and when the task is completed or no longer needed, users
can easily erase them by holding down on the item. Made a mistake? just tap on the item and an Edit 
page will popup, so you can correct any typo's or retitle the task.

## Notes

Some challenges that arose during the creation of this application:
- New Android Libraries and concepts to discover
- Occasional challenges with compiling, that were fixed due to IDE settings 
- Careful reading of the documentation because some instruction overlapped 
  and others were only mentioned in specific places
- [Genymotion](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Genymotion-2.0-Emulators-with-Google-Play-support) was very intuitive and works great, not a challenge, but worth
  mentioning and giving credit to :]
